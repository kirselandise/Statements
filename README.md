# Statements
Account Statements for CS353
Trinity McCann

### How to Run
Simply press the run button in Dr. Racket or run the file from the command line. Statements.rkt requires both ACCOUNTS.txt and TRANSACTIONS.txt to pull data from. It will automatically generate or update a STATEMENTS.txt output file, however you can also see the output generated in console for ease of testing. Unit testing through rackunit, below the code proper. 

### Credit
Code was not used from any materials outside of classwork. Claude and ChatGPT were attempted to write comments and do some debugging with methods, however the responses given were buggy or undesirable and not used. Some code was derived from the previous two projects, which did utilize some AI generated code which can be found underneath their README files. Additionaly, I worked with a few classmates, especially on some logic pieces and testing, however the code is fully original.
